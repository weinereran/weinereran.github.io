## Week 1 Progress
I've started the **Machine Learning Foundations** course on Coursera, and here's what I've achieved so far:

### Topics Covered
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
3. Gradient Descent Basics

### Key Takeaways
- Machine learning models can be broadly classified into **supervised** and **unsupervised** types.
- Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting parameters.

### Next Steps
For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- Complete the assignments for Week 2.
- Dive deeper into regression models and regularization.
